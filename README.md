# DataScorer

This small project is about recommendations. [Apache Mahout] (http://mahout.apache.org/) is a tool used to create scalable machine learning applications. Recommendations belongs to the field of machine learning. In this case we use a very simple example.

There's a [CSV file] (https://github.com/fazland/DataScorer/blob/master/input.csv) inside the project wich represent user's choice for a particular set of products.

Column 1 is for USER_ID | Column 2 is for PRODUCT_ID | Column 3 is for how user has rated the product (range 0-5)|
